I read Gelman et. al's Stan: A probabilistic programming language for Bayesian inference and
optimization this week. I thought it was a very concise summary of what Stan is and highlights the strengths and weakness of the package. The most interesting part of the article was section 3 which demonstrates the importance of setting a reasonable prior. I guess that one learns how to do so through experience.
